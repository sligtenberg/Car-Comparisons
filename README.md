# Stevo's Car Database Intro

Stevo's Car Database is a tool for user to compare cars side-byside.

# Implementation

To install Stevo's Cars, clone the repository to your local environement. Car data is stored in the db.json file. Start a JSON server to access it using the command:

$json-server --watch db.json

This will create a server storing the car data at http://localhost:3001/cars. In another terminal window, run the command:

$npm run server

This will run the backend on the port 3001

# Using the app

Available cars are listed on the left. Use the filter at the top to filter cars by stated criteria. Use the NavBar to navigate between comparing cars, adding a new car, or leaving a comment.

While comparing cars, click a car in the list to add it to the comparison container. Click the care make or model in the comparison container to remove it. Notes are displayed in a text area and may be modified. Once submitted, the new notes persist to the server.

When adding a car, fill out the form with the new car's information and then click submit. This will add the car to the list on the left and to the database on the server.

On the comments page, past comments may be viewed. New comments can be added with the new comment form. Old comments can be deleted by clicking the "X" on the right hand side of the given comment.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
